# Project 6: Creating Classes with Inheritance

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you will:

- Gain experience creating and working with classes with inheritance.
- Enhance your skills in creating and working with classes.
- Gain more experience debugging code.
- Gain more experience using a generic block of code to process data.
- Enhance your ability to interpret functional descriptions and specifications to complete an assignment.
- Gain more experience writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code using Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
- Practice using modern JavaScript syntax.
- Gain more experience working with static data.

## Overview

In this project, you will create three classes: Shape, Rectangle, and Triangle. The Shape class will serve as a base class for the Rectangle and Triangle classes, which will inherit from it. Inheritance allows child classes to inherit properties and methods from a parent class.

The Shape class will provide a method to calculate the perimeter, while the Rectangle and Triangle classes will each provide their own method to calculate the area.

### Project Tasks:

1. **Shape Class:**
   - Create a Shape class with a method to calculate the perimeter.

2. **Rectangle Class:**
   - Create a Rectangle class that inherits from the Shape class.
   - Implement a method to calculate the area specific to rectangles.

3. **Triangle Class:**
   - Create a Triangle class that also inherits from the Shape class.
   - Implement a method to calculate the area specific to triangles.

4. **Debugging and Testing:**
   - Debug the code to ensure it functions correctly.
   - Test the classes with sample data to verify their functionality.

Completing this project will provide you with valuable experience in working with classes, understanding inheritance, debugging code, and implementing object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript.
