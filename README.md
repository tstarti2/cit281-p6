# Project 6: Creating Classes with Inheritance

In this project, I focused on achieving several key learning objectives through the creation and implementation of classes with inheritance. Here's a summary of what I accomplished:

## Learning Objectives

- **Working with Classes and Inheritance:** I gained experience creating and working with classes, utilizing inheritance to create specialized subclasses with shared properties and methods.
- **Debugging Skills:** I further enhanced my debugging skills by identifying and resolving issues within the codebase to ensure its proper functioning.
- **Data Processing:** I practiced using a generic block of code to process data, applying it to various scenarios within the project requirements.
- **Interpreting Functional Descriptions:** I strengthened my ability to interpret functional descriptions and specifications to complete project assignments accurately.
- **Node.js Development:** I continued to refine my skills in writing and executing non-web server Node.js JavaScript code using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as my primary development environment.
- **Modern JavaScript Syntax:** I utilized modern JavaScript syntax throughout the project, ensuring adherence to best practices and standards.
- **Working with Static Data:** I gained more experience working with static data, leveraging it within the context of the project requirements.

## Overview of Project Tasks

1. **Shape Class:** I created a Shape class, laying the foundation for the Rectangle and Triangle classes by providing a method to calculate the perimeter.
2. **Rectangle Class:** I implemented a Rectangle class that inherits from the Shape class, incorporating a method to calculate the area specific to rectangles.
3. **Triangle Class:** Similarly, I created a Triangle class that inherits from the Shape class, implementing a method to calculate the area specific to triangles.
4. **Debugging and Testing:** I meticulously debugged the code to ensure its proper functioning and rigorously tested the classes with sample data to verify their functionality and accuracy.

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in working with classes, understanding inheritance, debugging code, and implementing object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript, further solidifying my skills as a developer.
